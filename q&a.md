# q&a
### Can you make a version of the mod which does X?
No, sorry.
### Is this mod compatible with Y mod?
Dunno. Maybe. If your mod has custom player models then it's no.
### I found a bug in the mod.
If you want to inform me about it, an e-mail is the quickest way to reach me. I might not always respond though. Take a look at buglist.md to be sure the bug isn't already listed.
### Where are the comments on gamebanana?
Send me an _e-mail_ if you want to get in touch with me.
### What can I contact you about?
Must have something to do with the mod.
### Where did the steam group go?
It was a ghost town so I retired it.

Where did *you* go?

(this is for people who were in my friendlist) I'm not using Steam anymore and my account is -again- queued for deletion. (I can still use steamCMD to update the mod).
