# q&a
### Can you make a version of the mod which does X?
No, sorry.
### Is this mod compatible with Y mod?
Dunno. Maybe. If your mod has custom player models then it's no.
### I found a bug in the mod.
If you want to inform me about it, an e-mail is the quickest way to reach me. I might not always respond though. Take a look at [buglist.md](https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/blob/master/buglist.md) to be sure the bug isn't already listed.
### What can I contact you about?
As long as it's not pointless, anything.
### Where did the steam group go?
It was a ghost town so I retired it.
