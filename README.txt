This is a repository for the mod originally hosted on Gamebanana.
I'll try to update it alongside the other version.

This version doesn't have numbers at the end, I'll simply add a "release" whenever the mod receive an update, so the mod's name won't change. I think this means the mod should update automatically if people added it to their repo? I dunno, too new to understand.


To install it, place it into:
steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom
