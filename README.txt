This is a repository for the mod originally hosted on Gamebanana.

These versions don't have release numbers at the end, I'll simply replace them whenever they receive an update so the vpk files names won't change.


On Windows, place any .vpk file into:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

On Linux, place any .vpk file into:
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom

If you don't know where your game is installed, you can also go on the game's page in your library.
click the settings icon > Manage > Browse local files
