# nhcustom

nhcustom is a (wip) application whose purpose is to modify the no-hats-bgum mod.
It looks for a configuration file named "config.txt" and executes the actions
specified in it.

**Do not move** the .exe file out of the folder. It needs to be in the same
directory as the config file, the database file (database.txt), the input
folder and the output folder.

Source code isn't yet available, but it will be once the program is complete and
polished enough.


The database is, as far as I can tell, ~~mostly complete~~ NOT complete at all, my bad. 
But the program or the database are nowhere near perfect. If you encounter a proplem
(e.g. you can't make a hat (dis)appear, the resulting mod is behaving strangely),
feel free to contact me.


The first thing you have to do before trying to run this program is to go and
download an uncompressed version of no-hats-bgum. You can download an up-to-date
version here:

https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/blob/master/nhm_source/mechbgum_no_hats_mod/no_hats_bgum.zip

Place it in the "input" folder. Be sure the filepath is the same as this one: `input/models/...`


## Dependencies

This application is written in c# (Mono).

For Windows, it will most likely work out of the box (at least it did for me)
but I cannot guarantee it. if it doesn't, it is probably because you don't have
a .NET framework installed. See this link:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework

For Linux, no dependencies are required as the executable comes bundled with
every library it needs (explaining its big filesize). It was tested on
Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 32.

Info: to run the program on Linux, cd in the same directory as the program and
type "./nhcustom".


## The config file

**Heads-up:** The program is CASE-SENSITIVE. Be sure that you put the exact name
of what you want in the config file. Refer to the teamfortress wiki to get
the correct names of the cosmetics or anything else you want to include in it.

Anything in the config file is what you **don't** want to see in-game.
If you want the config to have the opposite effect, you can type a date
that removes all cosmetics and only work with exceptions from there.
Continue reading to know what I'm talking about.


**What you can specify in the configuration file:**

* The name of a hat (ex: Fancy Fedora)

* An update (ex: Scream Fortress 2013)

* An equip region (ex: Feet)

* A class (ex: Demoman)

* A date (ex: 2015 or 2015/2016 or 2015-05-02/2016-09-10)

*info: if you type something like "2015/2016" in the config file, the program
will interpret it as "2015-01-01 to 2016-12-31". use "2015" if you only want to
remove this year.*

### Exceptions (!)

You can also tell the program to make exceptions for specific hats/updates/etc.
Just add a "!" at the beginning of the line. So if you wanted to remove every
hat from 2007 but keep the Fancy Fedora (came out it 2007), here's what you'd
write in the config file:

	2007
	!Fancy Fedora

Be aware that the program reads the config file line by line, so if you enter a
new line that affects the exceptions you made earlier, they will be canceled.

don't do this:

	2007
	!Fancy Fedora
	2007/2008

### Asterisks (\*)

Imagine you want to remove every cosmetics that the Scout can wear. You'd
think you only need to type "Scout" in the config file, but this isn't actually
true. The program will only remove hats that are "only" for the scout, leaving
a lot of multi-class cosmetics untouched. If you want to do this, append a "\*"
to the class, like so:

	Scout*

Now, the program will remove any cosmetics that can be worn by the scout, not
only scout exclusive ones. You would also want to remove all-class cosmetics,
as they don't refer to any class specifically in the database.

Something like this:

	Scout*
	All classes

*(this is a limitation of the program. There is also no way to remove with a
single line cosmetics that are worn by multiple classes, say the Scout,
Soldier and Engineer, but that are not considered "all-class" cosmetics,
since they aren't worn by every class. You would need to type each of those
hats manually. Some improvements are needed here.)*

Info: Appending a "\*" also works with equip regions, but nothing else.

### Comments

You can make comments in your config file. Add a "#" before any of them. ex:

	#Here is a comment
	2007 #You can also add them on the same line as a parameter
	#Everything written after a "#" is ignored, so don't write parameters after one.


## The input folder

This is where you need to place a (UNCOMPILED, so not a .vpk file) version
of the mod. The program will search for files in it and copy them over the
output folder based on the instructions of the config file.

You can decompile the mod and place it in this folder, or you can download an
already decompiled and up to date version here:
https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/blob/master/nhm_source/mechbgum_no_hats_mod/no_hats_bgum.zip

Be sure the filepath is the same as this one:
`input/models/...`


## The output folder

The resulting mod will be placed in this folder. **It is wiped clean everytime you
run the program, so make sure that you backup anything you want to keep.** If the
output folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

**The resulting mod isn't compiled.** Refer to these 2 videos to know how to compile
it to a VPK file and install it.

## The database

Every cosmetic is referenced in this file, alongside every class they are for,
every equip regions they occupy, with which update they came with, their release
date, and their filepath in the game. The database may (and probably do) contain
wrong information in it (e.g wrong paths, dates, equip regions, etc.) If you find
something wrong in it, I'd be happy to correct it.

Note: You don't need to contact me about the red errors that may appear when you
run the program, I'm well aware of them :D

(Unless you think there really is a problem. If you doubt, sending me an e-mail
won't hurt anyone.)

The program doesn't contain hard-coded lists for updates, hats or anything, it
scans the database for everything it needs. So I guess that if you add custom
entries to it, it *should* work. I haven't tested this though.

### Config file entries

**Info:** Some lines here don't work because either the database or the no-hats-mod
doesn't support/contain them. They are marked as not working.

Here's what you can put in the config file:
