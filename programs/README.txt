Thank you for trying out this little project.

nhcustom is a (wip) application whose purpose is to modify the no-hats-bgum mod.
It looks for a configuration file named "config.txt" and executes the actions
specified in it.

DO NOT MOVE the .exe file out of this folder. It needs to be in the same
directory as the config file, the database file (database.txt), the input
folder and the output folder.

Source code isn't yet available, but it will be eventually.


================================================================================
You WILL see a certain number of cosmetics still appearing whith the mod created
by this program. This is because of the database, which is incomplete, but I'm
working on it.
================================================================================



==============
-DEPENDENCIES-
==============

This application is written in c# (Mono).

For Windows, it will most likely work out of the box (at least it did for me)
but I cannot guarantee it. if it doesn't, it is probably because you don't have
a .NET framework installed. See this link:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework

For Linux, no dependencies are required as the executable comes bundled with
every library it needs (explaining its big filesize). It was tested on
Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 32.



=================
-THE CONFIG FILE-
=================

Heads-up: The program is CASE-SENSITIVE. Be sure that you put the exact name
of what you want in the config file. Refer to the teamfortress wiki to get
the correct names of the cosmetics or anything else you want to include in it.

Anything in the config file is what you DON'T want to see in-game.
What you can specify in the configuration file (a list of every possible
entries is provided at the bottom of this text file):

The name of a hat (ex: Fancy Fedora)

An update (ex: Scream Fortress 2013)

An equip region (ex: Shoes)

A date (ex: 2015 or 2015/2016 or 2015-05-02/2016-09-10)
info: if you type something like "2015/2016" in the config file, the program
will interpret it as "2015-01-01 to 2016-12-31". use "2015" if you only want to
remove this year.

A class (ex: Demoman)

You can also tell the program to make exceptions for specific hats/updates/etc.
Just add a "!" at the beginning of the line. So if you wanted to remove every
hat from 2007 but keep the Fancy Fedora (came out it 2007), here's what you'd
write in the config file:

2007
!Fancy Fedora

Be aware that the program reads the config file line by line, so if you enter a
new line that affects the exceptions you made earlier, they will be canceled.

don't do this:
2007
!Fancy Fedora
2007/2008

Also: imagine you want to remove every cosmetics that the Scout can wear. You'd
think you only need to type "Scout" in the config file, but this isn't actually
true. The program will only remove hats that are "only" for the scout, leaving
a lot of multi-class cosmetics untouched. If you want to do this, append a "*"
to the class, like so:

Scout*

Now, the program will remove any cosmetics that can be worn by the scout, not
only scout exclusive ones. You would also want to remove all-class cosmetics,
as they don't refer to any class specifically in the database.

Something like this:

Scout*
All classes

(this is a limitation of the program. There is also no way to remove with a
single line cosmetics that are worn by multiple classes, say the Scout,
Soldier and Engineer, but that are not considered "all-class" cosmetics,
since they aren't worn by every class. You would need to type each of those
hats manually. Some improvements are needed here.)

Info: Appending a "*" also works with equip regions, but nothing else.

You can make comments in your config file. Add a "#" before any of them. ex:

#Here is a comment
2007 #You can also add them on the same line as a parameter
#Everything written after a "#" is ignored, so don't write parameters after one.



==================
-THE INPUT FOLDER-
==================

This is where you need to place a (UNCOMPILED, so not a .vpk file) version
of the mod. The program will search for files in it and copy them over the
output folder based on the instructions of the config file.

You can decompile the mod and place it in this folder, or you can download an
already decompiled and up to date version here:
https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/blob/master/nhm_source/mechbgum_no_hats_mod/no_hats_bgum.zip

Be sure the filepath is the same as this one:
input/models/...



===================
-THE OUTPUT FOLDER-
===================

The resulting mod will be placed in this folder. It is wiped clean everytime you
run the program, so make sure that you backup anything you want to keep. If the
output folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

The resulting mod isn't compiled. Refer to these 2 videos to know how to compile
it to a VPK file and install it.

==============
-THE DATABASE-
==============

Every cosmetic is referenced in this file, alongside every class they are for,
every equip regions they occupy, with which update they came with, their release
date, and their filepath in the game. It's incomplete and is missing a lot of
filepaths, but it's complete enough to be tested. You don't need to contact me
about missing or wrong paths, I'm well aware of them ;D

The program doesn't contain hard-coded lists for updates, hats or anything, it
Scans the database for everything it needs. So I guess that if you add custom
entries to it, it should work. I haven't tested this though.
