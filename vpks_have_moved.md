As of March 30th, 2023, no_hats_bgum.vpk has finally reached GitHub's
file size limit of 100MB. I then decided to reupload all the mods as
[releases](https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/releases), which
I think is more fitting for binary files.

This also means that the
[update scripts](https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/blob/master/scripts/update-nohats.cmd)
isn't working anymore.
