# No-Hats-Mod bgum

This is a pack of mods whose purpose is to remove some visual aspects from Team Fortress 2 (cosmetics, skins, unusuals and some christmas lights).

This is a repository for the pack originally hosted on Gamebanana.

These versions don't have release numbers at the end, I'll simply replace them whenever they receive an update so the .vpk files names won't change. This should mean you could add them to your personal tf2 repo to receive any updates as soon as they're out.


### no\_hats\_bgum.vpk

This is the main mod of the pack, it prevents the game from loading cosmetics. It also makes the default headgear reappear, should it be removed by the cosmetic the player is wearing. (E.g. no more soldiers jumping around without helmet, safety first amarite?)

### no\_bugged\_misc.vpk

Rarely, some pyro masks still appear in the main mod. This is because the mod is unable to replace them with the default pyro head so they're simply not showing up, due to a bug. For visibility reasons (snipers) I let them appear by default but you can use this mod if you want to remove them completely (even with it installed they will sometimes still appear due to the same bug).

### no\_hats\_creatorstf.vpk

This mod is for people playing in the creators.tf servers. It removes the custom cosmetics the servers add. I can't guarantee that this mod will stay up to date since I don't know how often new cosmetics will be released. This mod is intended to be installed with the main mod.

### no\_unusuals.vpk

This file removes unusual particles but doesn't work on Valve servers (because of their sv_pure 1 list). I'm not the the person maintaining this mod thus I will not update it if some unusuals are still appearing.

### no\_christmas\_lights.vpk

Removes christmas lights from festivized weapons. Not to confuse with the limited **festive** weapons, not affected with this mod. Their lights aren't removed because they are baked in the weapon models, which would require to replace it, meaning it wouldn't work on Valve servers.

### no\_skins.vpk

This file removes the majority of the weapon skins, with some exceptions. This mod doesn't work on Valve servers.

# Installation

On Windows, place any .vpk file into: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

On Linux, place any .vpk file into: ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom

If you don't know where your game is installed (maybe it's not in the default Library), you can always go on the game's page in your library. click the settings icon > Manage > Browse local files

# Bug report

If you ever come across a cosmetic not being replaced (or, more likely, a player not having the default headgear appearing), you can send me a friend request on Steam at https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fedora31 and I'll accept it **when I have time.** You can also post a new issue on this repo if you have a Github account.
