# Questions and Answers

- Can you make a version of the mod which does X?
    - No, sorry. You may want to look at [nhcustom2](https://github.com/Fedora31/nhcustom2) though, a program which can modify the mod. (If you want to still see some cosmetics or hide specific ones, it should come in handy.)
- Is this mod compatible with Y mod?
    - If your mod has custom player models then the answer is likely no.
- I found a bug in the mod.
    - If you want to inform me about it, an e-mail is the quickest way to reach me. I might not always respond though. Take a look at [Buglist](./BUGLIST.md) to be sure the bug isn't already listed. Please note that I've stopped working on the secondary mods, and seldom update them.
