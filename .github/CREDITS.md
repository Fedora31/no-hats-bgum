## Mods I made
 * "no_skins.vpk"
 * "no_christmas_lights.vpk"
 * "no_bugged_misc.vpk"
 * "no_hats_creatorstf.vpk"

## Special thanks

* "no_unusuals" was a really outdated mod coming from StabbyStabby's config who was completely updated by **Zach**.
  ### Thank you for your work!

* "no_hats_bgum.vpk" is the main mod I'm keeping up to date. It's based on [**Jeebsau**'s No Hats Mod](https://www.teamfortress.tv/35222/no-hats-mod), which is also an updated version of [**Hrbls**' mod](https://www.teamfortress.tv/16179/no-hats-mod), itself an updated version of **Tricky_X**'s mod. It was specifically made possible thanks to **Mechbgum**, who found the
way to make bodygroups reappear.
