  ### Thank you for your work!
  
* "no_hats_orig.vpk" is an outdated version of the mod which was removed from the pack the 2020.02.28. Based on [Jeebsau's No Hats Mod](https://www.teamfortress.tv/35222/no-hats-mod), wich is also an updated version of Hrbls' mod, itself an updated version of Tricky_X's mod. I left this in the file because why not

* Thanks to **H9lk** for overhauling the markdown files.
