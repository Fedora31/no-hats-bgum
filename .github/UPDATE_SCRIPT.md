# Update Script
Checks which VPKs you have installed,
compares their last modified date with the latest github commit,
and downloads ones that are out of date.

## How to
1. [Download]() and save it to your `custom` folder next to the nohats VPKs.  
2. Run it after a new update comes.

## Notes
- Windows 10 only
- It will fail if you have TF2 open
