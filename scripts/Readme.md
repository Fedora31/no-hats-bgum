# Update Script
Checks which `vpk`s you have installed,
compares their last modified date with the latest github commit,
and downloads ones that are out of date.

## How to
1. [Download](https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/releases) and save it to your `custom` folder next to the nohats VPKs.  
2. Run it after a new update comes.

## Notes
> Windows 10 only
> It will fail if you have TF2 open
