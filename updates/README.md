## Heads-up: 
* This is **deprecated** and willn't add new `vpks` after december 2020. If you want to update your custom mod, would recommend small program i made to replace this method. See this link: https://github.com/Fedora31/nhcustom

* Will add in this directory `vpk` files only removing cosmetics from specific updates, starting with one from **summer 2020**, so that the persons who have modified main mod can have latest hats disappear without completely starting from scratch everytime a new update with new cosmetics comes out.
> Note that - i won't do this for older updates.

* If you want to limit number of files in your `custom` folder, you could merge your custom version with the **appropriate** file(s) in this directory without the fear that your changes will be overwritten. 
> (Just don't merge with a file containing cosmetics you already modified in your mod. I'm saying this because I know someone will eventually try to do this.)
