I will add in this directory vpk files only removing cosmetics from specific updates, starting with the one from summer 2020, so that the persons who have custom versions can update them without completely starting from scratch everytime a new update with new cosmetics comes out. Note that I won't do this for older updates.

You could merge your custom version with the **appropriate** file(s) in this directory (if you want to limit the number of files in your `custom` folder) without the fear that your changes will be overwritten. (Just don't merge with a file containing cosmetics you already modified in your mod. I'm saying this because I know someone will eventually try to do this.)
