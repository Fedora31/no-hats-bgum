## Heads-up: this is **deprecated** and I will not add new vpks after december 2020. If you want to update your custom mod, I would recommend the small program I made to replace this method. See this link: https://github.com/Fedora31/no-hats-bgum/tree/master/programs

I will add in this directory vpk files only removing cosmetics from specific updates, starting with the one from summer 2020, so that the persons who have modified the main mod can have the latest hats disappear without completely starting from scratch everytime a new update with new cosmetics comes out. Note that I won't do this for older updates.

If you want to limit the number of files in your `custom` folder, you could merge your custom version with the **appropriate** file(s) in this directory without the fear that your changes will be overwritten. (Just don't merge with a file containing cosmetics you already modified in your mod. I'm saying this because I know someone will eventually try to do this.)
